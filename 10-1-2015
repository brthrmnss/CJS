Hi Jenny
Firstly, your new place is very nice. I have a few questions:

Checks - What is the mailing address for the rent payments? 
Move in- I have a foam mattress, and portable bed frame. I will not need a move in on Sunday b/c these items are packed in medium sized boxes 
 
Furniture - Technically I consider this lease is a long-term rental. Do you have an idea of the furniture you want in your new place?  If so I can help with the cost. This way you can stretch your budget and get what you really want, and it will be waiting for you when you move-in. I do not want to purchase and move new furniture, and move it again 4 months’ time.  Let me know if you are interested in discussing this further. 

Also we would require plates, utensils, pots and pans. Do you haveAgain, the same question applies - Do you want to purchase a new set for the new house? If so, I will subsidize the cost and leave them in the unit when I move out. 

Cleaning – I want to hire a clearer to clean the unit every 2 weeks. Did the previous owners/mailing list recommend any service? If not I will find one and I will let you know who I find so you know who is entering the unit. Also I noticed the floors were scuffed, the walls need to be cleaned and the bedroom closet needs to be ‘refreshed’. I will ask the cleaning service to handle these issues and let you know what they recommended.

Regards, 
Stephen
